# Project Name

PhoneZ is an android application UI experiment whereas I explore a different
UI strategy than using a application-dashboard to
tabbed-task-context UI approach.  Basically I take the HomeScreen UI concepts
of series of related screens and relate them in the horizontal direction
as corresponding to the tabbed activity that is launched from the dashboard
in the dashboard-to-tabbed activity UI approach.

The items of the dashboard-to-tabbed UI approach correspond to the vertical
stacks of horizontal screen pages that are also activities in my UI approach.
